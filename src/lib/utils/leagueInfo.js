  <p>A FEW RELEVANT NOTES at the top: 
- Draft deadline this season is moved forward to 11/4 (same as NFL) 
- With the added week to the NFL schedule, our post season play will begin Week 15 and conclude with the MONEY BOWL on Week 17. </p>

<p>What's Happening Gentlemen! </p>

<p>Welcome back to MO MONEY. Both JC and I would like to welcome you to the premier fantasy football league on the East Coast of Florida. You're going to want to put on your BIG GIRL PANTIES for this league ladies! Everything goes, trades, smack (oh yes, we love the smack), nothing or no one is safe! You will be testing your skills against the elite. Ten teams made up of grit and steel battling for domination, respect, bragging rights and the coveted first place MO MONEY GRAND CHAMPION trophy to display proudly and cherish until the following season! 
</p>
<h4>KEEPER RULES: </h4>
<ul>
<li>The 2022 draft order will be set before you must declare your 4 keeper players. The cost to keep a player is the draft round in which the player was selected, plus 1 round. This means you can't keep both your first and second round choices from the previous year (because they both would require your round 1 pick). 
</li>
<li>Each passing season, the associated cost to keep the same player increases by 1 round. 
</li>
<li>You may only ELECT to keep a player for 3 consecutive years. So if you draft a guy year 1, that means you can keep him for a total of 4 years if you choose to keep him the following 3 seasons. 
</li>
<li>If a drafted player is traded or dropped, the draft rights to that player is transferred to any new subsequent owner. 
</li>
<li>Any undrafted free agent that is acquired via the waiver wire may be kept at the cost of your 9th round pick. Each subsequent year the player is kept, the cost increases by 1 round. If you keep multiple undrafted free agents, the associated cost for each is based on the order in which the player was acquired. 
</li>
<li>If two players that are kept have the same draft penalty, one player will carry a penalty of +1 round. E.g., if you keep 2 undrafted free agents, the first one acquired will cost you an 8th round pick, the second will cost a 9th. 
</li>
</ul>
<h4>LEAGUE ENTRY FEE: </h4>
<p>$270 Buy In Per Team </p>

<h4>WAIVERS</h4>
<p>waivers will be processed via FAAB only like last year (Tues and Friday nights), EXCEPT on Sunday before kickoff, where eligible players can be added instantly as free agents at the cost of $1 FAAB. A automated report will also go out after waivers clear, detailing all bids placed, including failed bids. 
</p>
<h4>PLAYOFF SEEDING </h4>
<p>First 5 gets in with W/L, 6th gets in as wild card via total points scored. First round bye for 1st and 2nd place in standings, but the remaining 4 teams are seeded based on total points scored. 
</p>

<h4>PAYOUTS</h4>
<p>1st $1,500 & MO MONEY GRAND CHAMPION TROPHY 
2nd $750 
3rd $270</p>
